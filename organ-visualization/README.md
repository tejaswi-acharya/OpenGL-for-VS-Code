# Organ Damage Visualization
Computer Graphics Semester Project|IOE,Pulchowk Campus

A real-time interactive visualization of progressive organ damage using OpenGL (GLFW + GLAD) in C++. The project demonstrates core computer graphics algorithms through anatomically-styled 2D organ simulations with stage-by-stage damage progression.

## Organs

### Lungs — Smoking Damage
Visualizes progressive lung damage caused by long-term smoking across 6 stages from healthy tissue to critical end-stage disease. Features animated cigarette smoke particles, bronchial tree rendering, and breathing animation.

### Liver — Alcohol Damage
Visualizes progressive liver damage caused by chronic alcohol consumption across 6 stages from healthy to cirrhosis. Features a tilted bottle pouring alcohol onto the liver surface, IVC and hepatic artery vessels, and damage spot accumulation.

| Stage | Lungs | Liver |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Healthy Lungs — 1 Month | Fatty Deposits — 1 Month |
| 2 | Early Irritation — 1 Year | Steatosis — 1 Year |
| 3 | Tissue Darkening — 5 Years | Hepatitis — 5 Years |
| 4 | Moderate Damage — 10 Years | Fibrosis — 10 Years |
| 5 | Severe Damage — 20 Years | Cirrhosis — 20 Years |
| 6 | Critical / End-Stage — 30 Years | End-Stage — 30 Years |

## Build Instructions

### Requirements
- Windows (MinGW / VS Code)
- OpenGL 2.1+
- GLFW 3.x
- GLAD

### Build (VS Code)
Open any `.cpp` file in `src/` and press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

The `tasks.json` compiles all source files:
```
g++ -std=c++17 src/glad.c src/renderer.cpp src/geometry.cpp
    src/animation.cpp src/lighting.cpp src/particles.cpp
    src/lungs.cpp src/liver.cpp src/main.cpp
    -Iinclude -Llib -lglfw3dll -lopengl32 -lgdi32
    -o src/organ_viz.exe
```

### Run
```
cd src
organ_viz.exe
```
> `glfw3.dll` must be in the `src/` folder for the executable to run.

## Technical Notes

**Organ animation**
Both organs breathe using `anim.breathScale()` — a sinusoidal oscillation around `1.0` applied to the contour scale each frame, driven by `anim.totalTime` which advances via `anim.update(dt)` in the main loop.

**Vessel translucency (Liver)**
The IVC (blue) and hepatic artery (red) are drawn before the liver body. The liver fill is fully opaque so it covers the vessels in the middle. Shine caps (`GL_TRIANGLE_FAN` half-ellipses) are drawn at the entry and exit points to give the appearance of tubes passing through the organ.
